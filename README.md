# CSCI 4302 - Advanced Robotics Final Project

## Official Repo Link `https://github.com/greg-lund/advanced_robotics_final_project`

Team: BJ Kim, Greg Lund, Matt Strong

Challenges Obtained:

- Literature Review on Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles
- Literature Review on Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Control
- Stopping Before a Stop Sign
- Creating a New Track


How to Run:

We have 3 separate world files (all with the same controller, so no extra work is needed for that):


`CSCI5302-AVChallenge1_new.wbt`: This world starts with the Tesla achieving the stop sign challenge.


`CSCI5302-AVChallenge1.wbt`: This world is the standard one, where the Tesla starts on the main, evaluation track.


`new_track.wbt`: This world includes the new track; upon opening this world, the Tesla will begin driving on our new track.
